### What your developers have to know:

# Just Execute `coala`

### Right where your `.coafile` lies.

And of course, coala works on **Linux**, **Windows** and **Mac**! Just make sure
to use **Python 3**.

You can also execute coala right from your editor. Check out
<https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala-gedit>,
<https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala-atom> or
<https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala-sublime>.

If you want to use coala to automatically review pull requests, consider using
[GitMate](http://gitmate.com/). Please mind that GitMate is a prototype.
